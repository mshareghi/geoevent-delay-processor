PROCESSOR_LABEL=Delay Processor
PROCESSOR_DESC=Release ${project.release}: Delays the processing of events by a specified amount of time. All delayed events are held in a sorted queue in memory. The queue is sorted by event time (based on the time field selected). <p><b>To clear the GeoEvent queue</b> Restart the service.<p><b>To clear the duplicate key cache</b> change any one of Updates Allowed, Use TRACK_ID, or Delay Time Field and save your changes (then change it back if you like). <p>Examples:<p><b>Time Field = RECEIVED_TIME, Allow Duplicates = Yes, Use TRACK_ID = No</b><br>These settings will simply delay every event by the delay time.<p><b>Time Field = TIME_START, Allow Duplicates = No, Use TRACK_ID = No</b><br>These settings will use the TIME_START value to determine if an event has already been received with the same start time value. If an event has an identical value for TIME_START to a previous event, the current event will be dropped.<p><b>Time Field = TIME_START, Allow Duplicates = No, Use TRACK_ID = Yes</b><br>These settings will use the TRACK_ID and the TIME_START values to determine if an event has already been received with those same values. If an event has identical values for both TRACK_ID and TIME_START to a previous event, the current event will be dropped.
